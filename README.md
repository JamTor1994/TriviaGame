# TriviaGame

this a a basic game where the user is timed to anwser 7 questions if they answer them correctly it turns gree if not red they get 60sec to answer. Game was pretty easy to make I mostly hard coded the buttons and timer creating multiple functions with one variable with multiple objects.
